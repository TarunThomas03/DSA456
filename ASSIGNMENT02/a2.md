## Part C - Analysis

In analyzing the operations of the sorted linked list, we find that the insert and remove functions, which maintain the sorted order, exhibit a linear time complexity of O(n). This arises because in the worst-case scenario, when the data needs to be inserted at the end of the list or removed from the end or when it's not present in the list, traversal of the entire list is necessary. Similarly, the is_present function, tasked with determining the presence of a specific data within the list, also demonstrates a linear time complexity of O(n) since it may require traversing the entire list to find the data or ascertain its absence. Conversely, the __len__ function, responsible for returning the number of nodes in the list, operates in constant time O(1) as it directly accesses the size of the list stored as a member variable.
