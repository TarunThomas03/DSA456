## Part A   
     
insert(self, key, value):       
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst-case scenario due to the nested loops used for sorting the table after each insertion.     
    
modify(self, key, value):      
Time Complexity: O(n) in the worst-case scenario because it iterates over the entire table to find the record with the matching key.      
   
remove(self, key):      
Time Complexity: O(n) in the worst-case scenario because it iterates over the entire table to find the record with the matching key and then shifts elements to fill the gap.     
    
search(self, key):      
Time Complexity: O(n) in the worst-case scenario due to linear search.     
    
capacity(self):     
Time Complexity: O(1)      
     
len(self):     
Time Complexity: O(n) because it iterates over the entire table to count the non-None elements.
